# Basic Data Structures Implementations

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this repository is for me to learn the basics of data structures. I'm implementing these to understand how they work fundamentally.

## Usage

Anyone is welcome to use this code, but please note that there are probably better, more efficient libraries available that accomplish the same things. This is primarily a learning exercise.

## Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following basic data structures:

- [X] **Array / vector** - Basic array operations
- [ ] **Linked List** - Singly and doubly linked lists
- [ ] **Stack (still list)** - LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure
- [ ] **Queue (still list)** - FIFO (First In First Out) data structure
- [ ] **Tree**
    - [ ] **Basic Binary Search Tree** - BST
    - [ ] **AVL Tree**
    - [ ] **Red-Black Tree**
    - [ ] **Splay Tree**
    - [ ] **Treap**
    - [ ] **Segment Tree**
    - [ ] **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)** 
    - [ ] **B-Tree**
    - [ ] **K-D Tree**
- [ ] **Set (Hash set)** - Set operations and implementations
- [ ] **Hash Table** - Hash map implementations
- [ ] **Graph** - Graph representations and algorithms
- [ ] **Heap** - Min/max heap implementations

## Note

I'm learning... Have patience! 😊
