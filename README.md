# basic_data_structures

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this repository is for me to learn the basics of data structures. I'm implementing these to understand how they work fundamentally.

## Usage

Anyone is welcome to use this code, but please note that there are probably better, more efficient libraries available that accomplish the same things. This is primarily a learning exercise.

## Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following basic data structures:

- **Array** - Basic array operations
- **Linked List** - Singly and doubly linked lists
- **Stack** - LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure
- **Queue** - FIFO (First In First Out) data structure
- **Tree** - Binary trees, BST, etc.
- **Hash Table** - Hash map implementations
- **Graph** - Graph representations and algorithms
- **Heap** - Min/max heap implementations

## Note

I'm learning... Have patience! 😊
